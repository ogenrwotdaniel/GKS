## Practice from the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes


## Chapter 01 Getting Started
##It`s best to use lowercase letters and underscores for files and folders names because python uses these naming conventions for files and folders.


## BEST PROGRAMMING PRACTICES
## 1. when a program contains an error, the interpreter will display an error message that describes the problem that was encountered. (traceback is an error message that includes a record of what the program was doing when it encountered the error.)
## 2. Syntax errors occur when Python can`t interpret the code.
## 3. Step away from the computer and take a break if you can`t figure out what is wrong with your code.
## 4. The best way to learn a new programming language is to write code.
## 5. Start over again
## 6. Ask someone else for help
## 7. Use a search engine to search for the error message you are getting.
## 8. Use the Python documentation to look up the error message you are getting.
## 9. Ask for help online.

print("Hello World!")
