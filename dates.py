## Practice from the book "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes

from datetime import datetime

## Chapter 01 Getting Started
##It`s best to use lowercase letters and underscores for files and folders names because python uses these naming conventions for files and folders.


## BEST PROGRAMMING PRACTICES
## 1. when a program contains an error, the interpreter will display an error message that describes the problem that was encountered. (traceback is an error message that includes a record of what the program was doing when it encountered the error.)
## 2. Syntax errors occur when Python can`t interpret the code.
## 3. Step away from the computer and take a break if you can`t figure out what is wrong with your code.
## 4. The best way to learn a new programming language is to write code.
## 5. Start over again
## 6. Ask someone else for help
## 7. Use a search engine to search for the error message you are getting.
## 8. Use the Python documentation to look up the error message you are getting.
## 9. Ask for help online.

print("Hello World!")



## Chapter 02 Variables and Simple Data Types

##As you write your programs, your editor highlights different parts of your code in different colors. This color-coding is called syntax highlighting, and it makes your code easier to read.
##Variables are used to store values that can change throughout the life of a program. A variable is a label that you can use to refer to a value or set of values stored in memory.
## Rules for naming variables:
## 1. Variable names can contain only letters, numbers, and underscores. They can start with a letter or an underscore, but not with a number.
## 2. Spaces are not allowed in variable names, so we use underscores to separate words in variable names.
## 3. Avoid using Python keywords and function names as variable names.
## 4. Variable names should be short but descriptive.
## 5. Be careful when using the lowercase letter l and the uppercase letter O because they can be confused with the numbers 1 and 0.
## 6. Python is case-sensitive, so the variable name message is different from Message.
## 7. Use the same case for all the letters in a variable name, or use underscores to separate words in a variable name.
## 8. Use descriptive variable names that convey the meaning of the values they store.


## 2.1 Assign a message to a variable and then print that message.
message = "Hello Python World!"
print(message)

## 2.2 Assign a new message to the variable and print that new message. Then change the value of the variable to a new message and print that new message.
message = "Hello Python Crash Course World!"
print(message)

## 2.3 Store a person`s name in a variable and print a message to that person. Your message should be simple, such as "Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?"
